Notes on the new ASL @glyf tag
==============================

2025-02-18 [not yet implemented]

Purpose:
========

@glyf supports non-contrastive variant (proto-)cuneiform glyphs for
@form and @sign and provides a place to define an ATF notation for
accessing them, their permanent location in the Oracc PUA, and their
accessibility via IVS as well as OpenType Font Features. This provides
a machine-readable way of recording in PCSL and OSL glyphs that are
not encoded as Unicode characters.

Note that @glyf is intended to support general, persistent recording
of only a selected subset of variant glyphs.  Many glyph variants will
exist beyond the definition of @glyf, accessible through font features
in specialized fonts.  For Oracc cuneiform fonts, each font has a
table giving details on the availability of variants which are
otherwise only defined within the fonts themselves.

The primary reasons for selecting variants for recording as @glyfs is
their presence in a major sign list (e.g., the CDLI github-repository
of Proto-Cuneiform signs) or their function as a significant
structural variant of a sign where the structural variant is not
deemed appropriate for encoding as a character (e.g., the various
avatars of DE‚ÇÇ as UMUM@s, |UMUM√óKASKAL|, |UMUM√óPA|).


Location:
=========

@glyf may occur zero or more times in the body of an @sign or @form;
this @sign or @form is referred to as the @glyf's parent.

@glyf entries must come at the end of the parent @sign block,
immediately before any @form, or at the end of the parent @form block,
immediately before the '@@'.

@glyf entries have no corresponding end tag; @glyf is terminated by
the next `@glyf', `@form', or `@end sign'.


Syntax:
=======

	@glyf ATF TAG UNI PUA IVS? OFF*

    COMPONENTS:
    -----------

    ATF is the base ATF identifier for this glyph--normally the
	parent.

    TAG is an allomorph or graphetic tag which is unique among the
	@glyfs which are the direct children of the parent.  Allograph
	tags begin with '~', then a letter, then zero or more
	alphanumerics.  In PCSL @glyf allograph tags may only begin
	with '~v' followed by digits; in PCSL these '~v' tags are
	reserved for use in @glyf and may not occur elsewhere in PCSL
	names.  Graphetic tags start with a '\' followed by digits.

    UNI is the Unicode character literal of the following PUA
	assignment.

    PUA is the permanent location of the @glyf in the Oracc PUA;
	@glyf PUA assignments start at U+FA000 in the Oracc PUA.

    IVS is an optional Ideographic Variation Sequence character
	which uniquely identifies the @glyf when it follows the
	Unicode value of the parent. IVS are given as uppercase E
	followed by four hex digits.

    OFF is zero or more OpenType Font Features which can be used to
	access the @glyf.  These may be SALT (.[0-9]+); CVNN character
	variations; or SSET Stylistic set codes.  Note that each OFF
	must begin with a '.' (period); this is part of the syntax of
	OFF in @glyfs.


Restrictions:
=============

A @glyf tag may not occur within the name of a @sign or @form.  In
PCSL this means that KU≈†U‚ÇÇ~a would be a legal sign or form name, but
SAG~v1 would not.

Examples:
=========

(1)

@sign SAG
@oid o0901677
@list U+12AA9
@ucun í™©
@uname SAG
@uage 1
@list ZATU437
@glyf SAG \1 Û¥ÄÄ FA000 E0001 .1 .cv01 .ss04
@glyf SAG \2 Û¥ÄÅ FA001 E0002 .2 .cv02
@list BAU228
@end sign

**Notes on Example (1)

@glyfs do not have an OID assignment.  Where they require one, an
XML:ID compliant version should be created by mapping '~' to '_' and
'\' to '-' and appending the result to the OID of the parent.

Only @sign or @form have the usual Unicode information.

A @glyf may have metadata elements like @list or @sys, but should
not have a Unicode `@list U+' entry.
